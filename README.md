### Explanation of these badges:

* **Project Status:**
    * `Status-Live-brightgreen`: Tells you the app is up and running.
    * `Version-1.0.0-blue`: Indicates the current version.
    * `License-MIT-yellow`: Shows the project's open-source license.

* **Tech Stack Badges:**
    * `Frontend-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=white`: This is cool! `?logo=react&logoColor=white` tells Shields.io to include the React logo. You can find many popular logos on [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/). The color `61DAFB` is React's official color.
    * Similar badges for Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS, using their respective logos and colors for instant recognition.

* **CI/CD & Hosting:**
    * `CI/CD-Passing-green?logo=github-actions`: A common badge for projects using Continuous Integration. If your CI pipeline passes, it's green!
    * `Deployed On-GitHub Pages-blueviolet`: Confirms where the project is hosted live.
